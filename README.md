CodeWorkBench is a personal C# practice enviroment built to strengthen core programming concepts through small, focused exercises.  
Each section of the project explores a different area of logic, such as prime numbers, loops, and basic abstraction.

## 🧠 Current Features
- **Prime number detection:** `IsPrime()` checks if a number is prime.  
- **Prime listing:** `PrintPrimesUpTo()` prints all primes up to a given limit.  
- **Demo method:** interactive console input/output for quick testing.
